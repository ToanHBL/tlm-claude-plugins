# Test suite for the harness hooks.
#
# Three classes of case, and the first two exist because the bugs they catch shipped in the
# repository this plugin was extracted from:
#
#   1. Executable check — read the hook list out of plugin.json and require every entry to exist and
#      carry the execute bit. A hook invoked by a bare path that is not executable fails silently,
#      and a silent failure reads exactly like a hook that decided to allow. One guard lived its
#      whole life that way, blocking nothing, and the evidence was negative: no log line ever named
#      it.
#   2. False refusal — every rule that blocks something also gets a case proving it has not opened
#      too wide. This half is more expensive to write than the blocking half, and skipping it is the
#      fastest way to get a guard removed by the person it keeps interrupting.
#   3. Behaviour — the configuration plumbing, including the worktree-prefix strip that every check
#      depends on.
