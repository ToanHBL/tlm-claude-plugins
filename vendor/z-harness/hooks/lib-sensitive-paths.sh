# Shared helper: the one list of paths this repository treats as sensitive, and the two questions
# asked about it.
#
# The list itself is not shipped with the plugin — it is a property of the repository the plugin is
# installed into. It is read from `.claude/harness.json`:
#
#   { "sensitivePaths": ["^src/billing/", "^migrations/"] }
#
# A repository may also excuse individual paths from the plan gate alone, for something under
# `.claude/` that is edited routinely and guards nothing:
#
#   { "planExempt": ["^\\.claude/tlm-plugin/"] }
#
# Two hooks used to carry their own copy of such a list, and three copies of one list is three
# chances to drift — the drift being silent, since a path dropped from one copy just stops being
# guarded there.
#
# Two questions, one list:
#
#   invariant_paths_regex   code where the properties no hook can read from a diff may break. A
#                           change here is worth a review before it is committed.
#   plan_paths_regex        the same code plus `.claude/` itself. A change here needs a written plan
#                           before the first edit: these are the places where a wrong turn is
#                           expensive, either because the damage is invisible in the diff or because
#                           the guard that would have caught it is the thing being edited.
#
# The second is derived from the first rather than written out again. Adding a path to the invariant
# group therefore also puts it behind the plan gate, which is the intended coupling.
#
# Usage:
#   source lib-sensitive-paths.sh
#   printf '%s\n' "$CHANGED" | grep -qE "$(invariant_paths_regex)" && ...
#   path_needs_plan "src/billing/charge.ts" && ...
#
# Requires jq.

# Prints the path of the configuration file, whether or not it exists.
#
# Resolved from the repository root rather than from the shell's cwd, because a hook runs with the
# cwd of the session and a session may sit in any subdirectory.
harness_config_path() {
  local root="${1:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}}"
  printf '%s/.claude/harness.json' "${root%/}"
}

# Code covered by the properties that are invisible in the text of a diff.
#
# Kept as one extended regular expression rather than a list of globs because both callers already
# feed it to grep -E over a newline-separated list of changed files. Prints nothing when the
# repository declares no sensitive paths; every caller treats an empty regex as "matches nothing",
# never as "matches everything", which is the failure an empty pattern would otherwise cause.

# The invariant group plus the harness itself.

# Paths the repository has excused from the plan gate, even though plan_paths_regex covers them.
#
# `.claude/` is gated wholesale because editing a hook can quietly remove a check. But a repository
# may keep something under `.claude/` that is edited constantly and is not a guard at all — a
# vendored copy of a rules plugin, say, whose whole design is that you edit it mid-conversation and
# the change is live on the next turn. Gating that is not caution, it is a plan file per typo, and a
# gate that fires on the ordinary case is the one that gets deleted along with the gates that matter.
#
# Declared by the repository, never here:
#
#   { "planExempt": ["^\\.claude/tlm-plugin/"] }
#
# Narrow on purpose. It excuses the *plan* gate only — a path in `sensitivePaths` stays invariant
# code, still reviewed, still covered by `reviewReceipt`. Excusing both from one key would let a
# repository turn off the review by asking for less typing.
#
# The empty case is the trap this whole file keeps re-learning: an empty regex handed to grep matches
# every line, so an absent or empty `planExempt` must mean "exempt nothing". Every caller checks for
# a non-empty pattern before matching, never after.
